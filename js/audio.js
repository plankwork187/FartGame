   AUDIO.JS — FART SOUND EFFECTS
   ============================================================================
   Two sound categories:
     SMALL_FARTS — short "tap" sounds. One is picked at random and played
                   once whenever the player does a quick tap/click release
                   (not a sustained hold).
     LONG_FARTS  — sustained "charging up" sounds. One is picked at random
                   and started (looping) the moment the player begins
                   holding a direction, and stopped the instant they
                   release the button. Meant to layer under the visual
                   power-ring charge-up.

   PLACEHOLDER FILES: the paths below do not need to exist yet — HTMLAudio
   fails silently (caught + logged, never throws into game logic) if a
   file 404s, so the rest of the game is unaffected until real files are
   dropped in at these paths. Replace the placeholder filenames with real
   ones later; no other code needs to change.

   USAGE (wired from player.js):
     AUDIO.startLongFart()      — call when a hold begins (PLAYER.startHold)
     AUDIO.stopLongFart()       — call when a hold ends (PLAYER.stopHold)
     AUDIO.playSmallFart()      — call on a quick tap release (short hold)
     AUDIO.playInvoluntaryFart() — call when the gas meter fills completely
                                   and an involuntary release happens
                                   (game.js's handleInvoluntary). Reuses the
                                   short SMALL_FARTS pool since an involuntary
                                   toot is a quick one-shot, same as a tap.
