/* ============================================================================
   DATA.JS — ALL EDITABLE GAME CONTENT LIVES HERE
   ============================================================================
   This file is intentionally separate from the game logic. If you want to:
     - add a character              -> edit CHARACTERS
     - add a location                -> edit LOCATIONS
     - add a companion type          -> edit COMPANIONS
     - change/add dialogue lines     -> edit DIALOGUE
     - add a special modifier        -> edit MODIFIERS
     - change time-of-day options    -> edit TIMES_OF_DAY
   You should NOT need to touch generator.js, game.js, npc.js, cloud.js,
   or ui.js to add new content — just add entries to the lists below using
   the same shape as the existing entries.

   Nothing in this file references images directly by guessing filenames
   blindly — every image path goes through ASSETS (see assets.js), which
   falls back to a drawn placeholder if the PNG isn't there yet. So you can
   write new content here BEFORE you have art, and drop in PNGs later.
   ========================================================================= */


/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   CHARACTERS
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Each character is an original mascot for this game (not a real person).
   `faces` keys must match the face states the game uses:
     disc_low, disc_high, lean1, lean2, lean_ext, relief, caught1, caught2
   `voiceName` is just used in dialogue text substitution if you want lines
   like "{name} sighs in relief."
   `personality` is a free-text hint used to flavor auto-generated VN lines
   for locations that don't have character-specific overrides.

/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   LOCATIONS
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Each location is a believable real-world setting. `bg` is the
   placeholder/real background image key (handled by assets.js).
   `baseNoise` (0-1) is the ambient noise level of the place itself BEFORE
   any modifiers are applied — noisy places (food courts) mask loudness;
   quiet places (libraries) make loudness much riskier.
   `depthBands` describes how NPC lanes are laid out for this location
   (some places are long and thin, others are wide and shallow).
   `flavorReasons` are reasons the character might be there — used by the
   procedural VN intro screen.
------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   CHARACTER SPECIALS — Special Move Framework (chars 1–9)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Each character can have one special move that activates via the ⚡
   button in-game. Set `enabled: false` to hide the button for a character.

   TO ADD/CHANGE A SPECIAL MOVE:
     1. Find the character entry below.
     2. Set enabled: true.
     3. Set label (button tooltip), cooldownMs (cooldown in milliseconds).
     4. Set fn: a function(game) that performs the effect. The game object
        exposes: game.getSuspicion(), game.setSuspicion(v),
        game.setStatus(text, ms), game.addGas(amount).
     5. Save and reload — the ⚡ button appears automatically in-game.
